### **COMMON QUESTIONS**

**Q: Why is TinyLlama taking so long to load?**
A: First load downloads ~600MB model. After that it's instant (cached).

**Q: Can I use this offline?**

**Q: How do I add my Claude API key?**
A: In Smart Dashboard, click "✨ Claude API", enter key, click "Save Key"

**Q: How do I connect the pipeline?**
A: Open `PIPELINE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions

**Q: What are these gates?**
A: Human Design gates (1-64). They map to consciousness coordinates.

**Q: What does U: x⊗a mean?**
A: Quantum formula for consciousness. x=Design, a=Personality, ⊗=fusion.
