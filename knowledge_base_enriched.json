An illustration of this energy is popular fads. Someone with individual energy does something new -- wears a new type of shoe or sports a new hairdo. At first society's reaction is, ''That's just weird.'' But after seeing it 5, 10, 20 times, other people start to do it and it catches on. You are here to introduce us to the new ideas.",
